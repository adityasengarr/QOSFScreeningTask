# QOSFScreeningTask

The solution is valid for all cases due to the fact that first the numbers were converted to binary strings including the sign of the binary string. For example, a 1 in the beginning of the binary string, if it was negative, and 0 on the other hand. Additionally, qubits were altered from top to bottom with the dominant strategy - in which the larger value corresponding bit in the binary string was changed with a X gate in the circuit. Oracles were also applied to compare the qubits, and the values in the bases, to get the greatest value.
