# QOSFScreeningTask

The solution is valid for all cases due to the fact that first the numbers were converted to binary strings including sign. For example, a 1 in the beginning of the binary string, if it was negative, and 0 on the other hand. Additionally, qubits were altered with the dominant strategy in which the corresponding bit in the binary string were changed with a X gate in the circuit, from top to bottom. Thus, the greater base in the binary string, were altered first.
